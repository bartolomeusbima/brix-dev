# Image File Naming & Formatting Guidelines

To maintain consistency and ensure optimal performance, please follow the guidelines below when preparing and naming images for the article pages.

## 1. File Naming Convention

- **Header Image**
  - Name the file: `header.jpg`
  - Only one header image per article.

- **Content Images**
  - Name using two-digit numeric sequence starting from `01`, `02`, `03`, and so on.
  - Example: `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, `03.jpg`, etc.
  - Images are ordered based on their appearance from **top-left to bottom-right** on the article page.

## 2. File Format

- Only use `.jpg` extension (lowercase).
  - ✅ `image.jpg`
  - ❌ `image.JPG`
  - ❌ `image.jpeg`

## 3. File Size

- Maximum file size: **300KB**
  - Compress images if necessary to meet this requirement.

## 4. Aspect Ratio

- All images must follow a **4:3 aspect ratio**.
  - Example resolutions:
    - 1600×1200 px
    - 800×600 px
    - Avoid unusual resolutions like `2421×1816 px` (not 4:3)
